The Node.js Foundation is a United States-based not-for-profit membership
corporation organized for the purposes of enabling the widespread adoption and
accelerated development of the Node.js platform and related open source
projects. Put simply: the Node.js Foundation is the home of the Node.js
Project.

The Node.js Project is a cluster of open source and openly governed projects
that define and support the Node.js platform.

The everyday technical operation of the Node.js Project is overseen by a Technical Steering Committee.
