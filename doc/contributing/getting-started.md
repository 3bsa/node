# Welcome to Node.js

First of all, welcome to the Node.js project and thank you for your interest
in contributing your time, effort, and experience to our shared goal of making
Node.js even better. This guide will provide a walk-through of everything you will need to get started.

## Code of Conduct

Before anything else, it is important to know that the Node.js project has, and
enforces a [Code of Conduct][] that explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations the Node.js Foundation requires of all contributors. Please take
a moment to read the Code of Conduct.

## Types of Contributions

Another very important thing to know is that while Node.js is a software
project, there are many ways to contribute to the community that do not
require a single line of code to be written. These include, but are not
limited to:

* Improving Documentation and How To Guides
* Answering questions (see https://github.com/nodejs/help)
* Reviewing Issues and Pull Requests
* Discussing potential new features (see https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps)
* Keeping minutes and taking notes during Working Group meetings
* Assisting with the education and outreach efforts
* Working to improve the diversity and inclusivity of our community
* Translating documentation to other languages

The general rule of thumb is simple: If you see something in any part of the
Node.js project that is not getting done, chances are we just need someone to
step up and be willing to do the work.

Exactly how to get started with various types of contributions is the purpose
of this guide.
